land_surface__net_radiation

==========================================================================
NOTE:  Inserting the word "incident" in "net_radiation" wouldn't make
       sense if the incident amount (from the atmosphere) exceeds the
       amount emitted by the land surface.

       But we need a convention to indicate that when "net_radiation"
       is positive, it means that amount is being received by the object
       under consideration.
===================================================================================
In TopoFlow:

Qn_LW  =  LW_in (from air) - LW_out (from surface)

Q_LW   =  (incident_longwave  - emitted_longwave)
Q_SW   =  (incident_shortwave - reflected_shortwave)

Q_sum  =  (Q_SW + Q_LW)  (called "Q_net" in Zhang paper)

The "incident_shortwave_radiation_flux" can be broken into 3 parts:
    atmosphere_to_land_surface__emitted_radiation_flux   ("diffuse radiation flux")
    atmosphere__backscattered_radiation_flux             ("backscattered radiation flux")
    atmosphere__transmitted_shortwave_radiation_flux     ("extraterrestrial radiation flux" or "direct")

Only the last one depends on whether the terrain is sloped or not.    

==================================================================================
From the point of view of the land surface (or sea surface) we can use:

    land_surface__backscattered_incident_shortwave_radiation_flux   ("downward")
  + land_surface__diffuse_incident_shortwave_radiation_flux         ("downward")
  + land_surface__direct_incident_shortwave_radiation_flux          ("downward")
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
    land_surface__total_incident_shortwave_radiation_flux           ( > 0 )
                  OR
    land_surface__net_shortwave_radiation_flux
                  OR
    land_surface__net_incident_shortwave_radiation_flux

Maybe (optionally) insert "slope_corrected" into the "direct" name:
    land_surface__slope_corrected_direct_incident_shortwave_radiation_flux
           OR
    land_surface__nonsloping_direct_incident_shortwave_radiation_flux

And for the longwave fluxes:
    land_surface__emitted_longwave_radiation_flux     ("upward")
  + land_surface__incident_longwave_radiation_flux    ("downward")
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
    land_surface__net_longwave_radiation_flux    (could be negative)

Then:
    land_surface__net_(incident)_longwave_radiation_flux
  + land_surface__net_(incident)_shortwave_radiation_flux
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
    land_surface__net_(incident)_radiation_flux   (could be negative)

Note that "total_incident_radiation" connotes a sign convention, namely
that a positive value is an amount RECEIVED by the land surface and
a negative value is an amount LOST.

However, the term "net_radiation" doesn't convey a sign convention, while
"net_incident_radiation" does.  But "net_incident" may be confusing.

We need to somehow indicate the sign convention that if:
    land_surface__net_radiation_flux > 0,  then land surface RECEIVES that amount
and if
    land_surface__net_radiation_flux < 0,  then land surface LOSES that amount.

Should we allow "longwave_radiation_flux" to be shortened to "longwave_flux" ??
It seems that it shouldn't be shortened;  see next section.

==================================================================================

Note that these names all follow the Process Name + Quantity Pattern:
    radiation_flux
    radiation_frequency
    radiation_wavelenth

    radiance = radiation_flux per unit of solid angle
               and the direction it is coming from must be specified (or isotropic).
               There are 44 CF names that contain "radiance".

The terms "rate" and "flow_rate" both imply extra units of [s-1].

In the context of "transport phenomena", the definition of "flux" is "flow
rate per unit area", which implies that units of [m-2 s-1] are added to the
base units. See: 
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_phenomena

The CF Standard Names do not make it clear that the units [s-1] are also
implied by the term "flux".

With this definition of "flux" we have:
    "mass_flux"     = [ kg m-2 s-1 ]
    "momentum_flux" = [ kg m s-1 m-2 s-1 ] = [ kg m-1 s-2 ] = [ Pa ]
                      (e.g. "shear_stress", "pressure", "force per unit area")
    "energy_flux"   = [ J m-2 s-1 ] = [ W m-2 ]
    "volume_flux"   = [ m3 m-2 s-1 ] = [ m s-1 ]
    "mole_flux"     = [ mol m-2 s-1 ]                ### (or "molar flux" ?)

With this definition of "flow_rate" we have:
    "mass_flow_rate"     = [ kg s-1 ]
    "momentum_flow_rate" = [ kg m s-1 s-1 ] = [ kg m s-2 ]
    "energy_flow_rate"   = [ J s-1 ] = [ W ] = power
    "volume_flow_rate"   = [ m3 s-1 ] = discharge
    "mole_flow_rate"     = [ mol s-1 ]                ### (or "molar flow rate" ?)

Note that "flow_rate" = (area * flux), or
          "flux" = "flow rate" / area.

==================================================================================

Q: How do we indicate that the radiation is travelling through the air
   or through sea water?

A: If the object name is "land_surface", "sea_surface" or "earth_surface"
   then we know it is travelling through air.  But it doesn't even matter
   in terms of how much radiation is reaching the surface.

        e.g. land_surface__diffuse_incident_shortwave_radiation_flux

   If the object_name is "sea_water" or "air" then we also know.

        e.g. sea_water__downward_shortwave_radiation_flux  (or downwelling?)

==================================================================================

Note: CSDMS Standard Names use "liquid_equivalent" instead of
      "liquid_water_equivalent", which would only apply to water.
      The substance involved is captured by the object name part.
