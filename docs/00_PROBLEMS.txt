TopoFlow Problems and/or Issues


Everywhere:
=============
* Move any remaining "unit_test" functions into separate files
  within components/tests or framework/tests.
  
* Rewrite the component instantiation tests so that each one
  is treated as the driver and the framework connects all of
  the required components.  This will mean creating a separate
  provider file for each component.

* Remove all calls to "set_grid_double";  see:
     diversions_base.py
     satzone_base.py
     
* Replace "np.size(" with "var.size" ??
     But make sure this works for all array dimensions, etc.
     Note that if: a=np.float(0), there is no size method,
     but for a=np.float64(0) there is.
* See if we can replace most "np.float64(value)" with the value.
* Check how float64 scalars are handled, and whether they are
  preserved as a reference, etc.  (0d numpy arrays, etc., use
  of [:] or ".fill", etc.
* Does Python have an "array" command, or just numpy?
* NetCDF writer needs to use CSDMS standard names.
* Clean up the way "model_output" works?

In channels_base.py:
=======================
* channels_base.py used to call diversions.update(), but now commented out.

In diversions.py:
====================
* self.cp.set_grid_double  still appears in update().
* Use of idl_func.eof() (This code is old: see diversions_fraction_method.)

In diversions_fraction_method:
================================
* Calls to self.cp.get_values_in_grid_double()
* Calls to self.cp.set_values_in_grid_double()

In evap_base.py:
==================
* Calls to "set_port_data"

In met_base.py:
=================
* There are commented calls to "set_port_data"

In satzone_darcy_layers.py:
=============================
* All code seems to be commented out?
